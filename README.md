## Introduction
This repo is designed to showcase some of the Nextflow bioinformatics work I am undertaking independently.

I am using Nextflow on WSL


## Script 1:
Simple initial script that I used to index a target genome with BWA

Genome: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/CP000325.1/


## Script 2:
Pipeline that uses nextflow to download 2 .fastq.gz files and assemble them with SPAdes (genome assembly algorithm)

Two distinct processes - download and assemble

spades.py was installed via conda
